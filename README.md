# Training Material for Microchip Security Solution  

## Overview

This training material includes three labs: 

* Using SAML11 and ATECC508/608 for authentication (folder name SAML11_ATECC_TZ)
* Using TrustedRAM feature in the SAML11 (SAML11_TrustRAM_TZ)
* Using  QTouch on SAML11 (SAML11_QTOUCH_TZ)

 For each lab, it is provided 2-page description, step-by-step guide (to go thru the lab), project template and solution.   

Please refer the [Installation guide](https://github.com/HaiQNguyen/MCPSecurityWorkshop/blob/master/Installation%20guide%20-%20README%20FIRST.pdf) for software installation.  

It is recommended to start first with the lab SAML11_ATECC_TZ since it shows you step-by-step how to set up a project running with TrustZone by using Atmel Start.
