* QT3 Xplained board
* Type A - micro USB cable

### Software

* Atmel Studio
* TeraTerm

## Description 

![Use case diagram](https://bitbucket.org/hainguyenprivaterepo/saml11_qtouch3/raw/1c3965249a527dc3779545e33792832308e16501/Image/Usecase_Diagram.png)

The secure application located in TrustZone initializes the PTC and process the input from the keypad. Whenever user presses a key,the pressed key is displayed on the console terminal. The user can enter the pass code through the keypad. The user can enter number from 0 â€“9 as pass code, clear the previous value, and start authenticating.

When the authentication process has been started, the secure application verifies if the passcode entered by user is correct or not, and prints the result on the console terminal.

## How to run the use case

Download the project to your machine  
Open the project with Atmel Studio  
Compile the project  
Start TeraTerm with the following configuration:  

* Baud: 9600
* Data: 8 bits
* Stop bit: 1 bit
* Parity: none

In Atmel Studio, run the project.

Enter the pass code using key pad from 0 to 9. The pass code has 5 digits. The correct pass quote is 63263

User can clear the previous digit by pressing keypad "C"

User can start authentication by pressing key "#"
